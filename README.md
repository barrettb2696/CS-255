CS-255 System Analysis and Design

The DriverPass project required me to determine the requirements and plan out how we were going to implement the requirements into the application.  The client, DriverPass, needed an application that allowed its users to take practice tests online and schedule driver training sessions in person to prepare for the tests at the DMV.  

Throughout the project I feel like I cleary conveyed the requirements throughout the business requirements document.  I was able to add in a lot of detail to ensure that nothing got missed.  If I could fix one thing within the project it would be the UML use case diagram.  I recognize that the diagram does not capture the complexity and size of the system and if I could go back I would add more structure to it.

The way that I interpreted the user's needs and implement them into the system design was by reading over the interview transcript and determining the requirements throughout the conversation.  At the end of the transcript there was a table that explicitely outlined the requirements of the project.  It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because they are going to be the ones using the system, so you want to make sure that they are satisfied with it to decrease extra costs and upset clients.  I take a soft and slow approach to designing software.  I think through every aspect of the project before starting the design process.
